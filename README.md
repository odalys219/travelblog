  <p id="travel">I've had the privilege of traveling since I was very young. I've been fortunate to have traveled on my own and with my family. As a travel enthusiast, I enjoy discussing the places I've visited throughout my life.  With so little time, traveling can be both exciting and stressful.  I've condensed the most important aspects of visiting these locations so that you can use it as a guide when visiting them. The most important thing is to always have fun! So here are the places I recommend visiting with family or on a solo vacation. I've listed each location here so you can get detailed information before visiting.</p>
